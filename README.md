Text Classification & Tokenization Project

Project Overview
This project processes and classifies text articles that have been **manually labeled into categories** (folders).  
The workflow includes:
1. Loading labeled text data
2. Tokenizing and cleaning the text
3. Preparing features for future machine learning models

The dataset is stored in a ZIP file, where each folder represents a label/category (Unzip Articles.zip for running the code).
